2. Variables

variable in programming is like a container or a named storage location that holds a value.
It's used to store information that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the program.

2.1 variable naming rules:

Start with a Letter or Underscore.  --- cant start with special character or number
Avoid Special Characters.  ---start,inside avoid special char
Case Sensitivity.              
Don't Use Reserved Keywords.       
Use Descriptive Names.           --- explain properly and shortly
Use CamelCase or Snake Case.



3. Data Types
defines the type of data that a variable can hold.

Integers (int)
Floating-point numbers (float)
Strings (str)
Booleans (bool)

# int - numbers [phone number, adhar number, pincode, 23435, 76, 787,  -7878]
# float - decimal numbers [temperarture, weight , height, amount] 34.789, 12.903, 134.67
# str - sequence of characters, '', ''' , [country, person name, pan card number, vehicle number plate, email] "Delhi", "vinie@example.com", "GFGFGJ%&%&^", "FGFGJ66757" , "55567567"
#bool - True / False

4. Operators
Operators in programming are symbols that perform operations on variables or values.

4.1 Arithmetic Operators:
Addition+ : Adds values together.
Subtraction - : Subtracts one value from another.
Multiplication * : Multiplies values.
Division / : Divides one value by another.
Modulo % : Gives the remainder after division.
Floor Division // :it gives the whole number part of the division result without the fractional part.



4.2 Comparison Operators:
Equal ==: Checks if two values are equal.
Not Equal !=: Checks if two values are not equal.
Greater Than > / Less Than<: Checks if one value is greater/less than the other.
Greater Than or Equal >= / Less Than or Equal <=: Checks if one value is greater/less than or equal to the other.


4.3 Logical Operators:
AND and: Returns True if both conditions are True.
OR or: Returns True if at least one condition is True.
NOT not: Reverses the logical state of the operand.


4.4 string operations
len()
concatenation.
conversion- upper,lower , ttitle, capitalize
replace, find
indexing and slicing
